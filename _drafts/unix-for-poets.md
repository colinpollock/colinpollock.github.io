["Unix for Poets"][1] is a twenty five page paper by Kenneth Church in which he uses standard Unix tools for doing text analysis over the Bible. I started coding in Python, which makes processing text super easy, so I rarely use Unix tools to do NLP. So I thought it'd be fun to familiarize myself with the methods in "Unix for Poets" by running them over all of the Seinfeld scripts.
